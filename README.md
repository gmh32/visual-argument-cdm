# visual-argument-cdm



For my visual rhetoric argument, I was toying around with the idea of portraying media, particularly social media and the culture of 
comparison that surrounds it, in a way that highlights it's potentially dangerous usage.  To do this, I explored the different ways 
in which I could use as little words as possible while still making the message as clear as possible.  
In particular, I was inspired by images of Banksy graffiti art I came across online many years ago.  
Though he does tend to feature some text in his works, he consistently uses images juxtaposed with the text or within the images 
(and here, I really mean spray paintings) alone to subtly but boldly portray his argument.  I looked through different stock image 
and icon websites (Unsplash, The Noun Project, etc), and was inspired by the idea of a prescription pill bottle.   
If I could design my visual argument so that the medicine inside the bottle represented the social media culture we intake, 
I would be able to make two statements: one, being that social media and sharing/posting online has been overinflated to an 
extent that almost makes it glorified in nature, a cure for all of our insecurities if we have enough followers, get enough likes, 
and receive the validation we are striving for so longingly.  The second statement I wish to make through this visual argument 
is through a more subtle detail that shows a (quite literal) tear in the system.  I wanted to incorporate a biohazard toxic symbol 
or poison symbol somewhere on the bottle underneath a label that is falsely marking the contents as "happy pills."
